Before dawn that day, he had loaded his Renault with five masterpieces from Picasso, Braque, Matisse, Léger and Modigliani, worth over 104 million euros, or about $112 million. All he left behind were empty frames, leaning against the museum’s walls.

“It’s one of my easiest and biggest heists,” Mr. Tomic told reporters on Friday outside the courtroom where he and two men accused as accomplices were on trial for the thefts.

Mr. Tomic has been likened in news articles here to Arsène Lupin, a fictional thief of the early 1900s who terrorized well-heeled Parisians. He has made a living robbing luxurious apartments of their masterpieces, sometimes using an arbalest, ropes, snap hooks and a harness to scale facades and gain entry. In 2000 he stole works by Renoir and Braque from two Parisian apartments, which earned him one of his 14 convictions to date.
